#12 Flutter Global Bloc || Dispose Bloc (local bloc)

✅ 1. Global BLoC
A Global BLoC is created at a high level (like main.dart) and shared across many widgets. It usually lives for the entire app lifecycle.
  
✅ 2. Local BLoC
A Local BLoC is tied to a specific widget/page and should be disposed when that widget is removed from the tree.
